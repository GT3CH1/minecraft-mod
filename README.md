## Installation

- Please install fabric from [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).
- Navigate to your Minecraft installation directory (Windows is usually `%appdata%`), and drop in the jar downloaded
  from the [releases page](https://github.com/gt3ch1/minecraft-mod/releases) to the `mods` folder.
- Start Minecraft! The default keybinding for the GUI is `I`. Each mod can have its own separate keybinding, or can be
  indivually toggled through the GUI.
